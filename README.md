# Emotion Data For Whatsapp Status
## Text Data For Whatsapp Status Emotion Prediction
This is a labeled dataset for a sentiment analysis. The original dataset is from 	[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sankha1998/emotion?select=Emotion%28happy%29.csv). 

The original data is somewhat poor, meaning that the given label might not actually fit the true emotion of the text. We are slowly going through the data to clean it. While doing that we created fourth sentiment `neutral`.

We will give a little definition of each sentiment below.

### `happy`
We label a text as `happy` if it sounds clearly happy and has a positive connotation and expresses light hearted and whimsical thoughts.


### `angry`
We label a text as `angry` if the text sounds angry, sarcastic or sassy. And it is usually accompanied by strong language such as curse words and aggresive wording.


### `sad`
To be labeled as `sad` the text expresses fear or insecurity and usually has a dark or gloomy tone.


### `neutral`
Status that are neither `happy` or `sad` nor express any particular sentiment are labeled as `neutral`. It can be advice or facts.
